                <p>The general dress code for the meeting is business casual. Although you might be able to get away with less, keep in mind that many important people will be walking around, so dress to impress! The only exception to this is the APSA Saturday night dinner, which is business attire (black tie optional). Also note that the hotel is generally on the colder side, so remember to bring layers.</p>
