Her laboratory is interested in understanding the pathomechanism of chronic kidney disease development. Susztak has made discoveries fundamental towards defining critical genes, cell types and mechanisms of chronic kidney disease. She was instrumental in defining genetic, epigenetic transcriptional changes in diseased human kidneys. She identified novel kidney disease genes and demonstrated the contribution of Notch signaling and metabolic dysregulation in kidney disease development. Her lab was the first to map the kidney epigenome and catalogue genotype-driven gene-expression variation (eQTL) in human kidneys. Integration of GWAS, eQTL and epigenome data has been essential to prioritize disease-causing genes and variants. Dr. Susztak generated the first unbiased, comprehensive kidney cell-type atlas using single cell transcriptomics. She identified that specific renal endophenotypes are linked and likely caused by the dysfunction of specific cell types."

Dr. Weyand’s research team has defined the role of T cells and dendritic cells in deviating immunity from protective to destructive and over the last decade, she has devoted special emphasis to the remodeling of the immune system with aging, how chronic disease ages the immune system, and how aged immune cells cause inflammation. She has defined molecular defects underlying the immune abnormalities driving rheumatoid arthritis, implicating defects in mitochondrial DNA repair and intracellular protein trafficking to lysosomal surfaces. Her team has defined metabolic signatures that are linked to pathogenic behavior of T cells and macrophages, representing novel targets for immunomodulatory therapy."

            "bio": "During MD/PhD training, I became fascinated by the human immune system, in particular, how the immune system recognizes and interacts with cancer. I was captivated by the premise that the body can recognize and eradicate cells that have gone astray and turned malignant. My thesis project explores how antigen presentation and lymphatic drainage works for brain tumors. The hope is that developing a better understanding of this process could potentially elucidate more effective treatment strategies. I aspire to have a career where I can apply information I learn from lab to patients I see in clinic, and vice versa. My hope is that this interplay between lab and clinic will allow me to more effectively aim scientific inquiry to solve relevant scientific problems and to ultimately improve disease outcomes."

Her research focus is on metabolic and genetic pathways of cardiometabolic diseases, integrating diverse genomic, metabolomic and proteomic techniques for identification of novel mechanisms of disease and biomarkers. Her multi-disciplinary molecular epidemiology lab within the DMPI has quantitative and molecular components and leverages several large cardiovascular biorepositories on which she is PI or co-I to perform discovery studies using omics technologies, with subsequent functional validation for mechanistic insight. Dr. Shah collaborates closely with the DCRI for biomarker discovery in biospecimens from clinical trials and she is the Duke PI for the Verily Project Baseline study. She has partnered with the Duke Global Health Institute (DHGI) to identify disease biomarkers in global populations through a study of metabolic and genomic biomarkers of type II DM and CAD in Gurgaon, India. Dr. Shah is also Director of the Duke Adult Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic where she cares for patients and their families who have, or are at risk of, cardiovascular genetic disorders. Her training includes receiving a M.H.S. in epidemiology from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, a Master’s degree in Medical Genomics from Duke University, and completing a research fellowship in genetic epidemiology at the Duke Center for Human Genetics."

He received his A.B. from Oberlin College and his M.D. from the University of Chicago. After completing his clinical training in internal medicine and gastroenterology, and doing a post-doctoral fellowship at the NIH, he joined the faculty at Washington University where he has spent his entire career; first as a member of the Departments of Medicine and Biological Chemistry, then as Head of the Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology, and for the past decade as founding Director of the University’s interdepartmental Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology. Members of his lab have developed gnotobiotic animal models, and new experimental and computational approaches to characterize the assembly, dynamic operations, functional properties, and biological effects of human gut microbial communities. He has combined these models with human studies involving twins as well as members of birth cohorts living in low-, middle- and high-income countries. His group is focused on addressing the global health challenges of obesity and childhood undernutrition through new understanding of the interactions between diets and the gut microbiome and through new ways of promoting healthy development of the gut microbial community during the first several years of postnatal life. To date, he has been the research mentor to 137 PhD and MD/PhD students and post-doctoral fellows. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Philosophical Society."
