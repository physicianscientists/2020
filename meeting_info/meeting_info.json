Her laboratory is interested in understanding the pathomechanism of chronic kidney disease development. Susztak has made discoveries fundamental towards defining critical genes, cell types and mechanisms of chronic kidney disease. She was instrumental in defining genetic, epigenetic transcriptional changes in diseased human kidneys. She identified novel kidney disease genes and demonstrated the contribution of Notch signaling and metabolic dysregulation in kidney disease development. Her lab was the first to map the kidney epigenome and catalogue genotype-driven gene-expression variation (eQTL) in human kidneys. Integration of GWAS, eQTL and epigenome data has been essential to prioritize disease-causing genes and variants. Dr. Susztak generated the first unbiased, comprehensive kidney cell-type atlas using single cell transcriptomics. She identified that specific renal endophenotypes are linked and likely caused by the dysfunction of specific cell types."

            "bio": "Jay is an MD/PhD student working with Dr. Gavin P. Dunn at Washington University School of Medicine. During MD/PhD training, he became fascinated by the human immune system, in particular, how the immune system recognizes and interacts with cancer. He was captivated by the premise that the body can recognize and eradicate cells that have gone astray and turned malignant. His thesis project explores how antigen presentation and lymphatic drainage works for brain tumors. The hope is that developing a better understanding of this process could potentially elucidate more effective treatment strategies. He aspires to have a career where he can apply information he learns from lab to patients he sees in clinic, and vice versa. His hope is that this interplay between lab and clinic will allow him to more effectively aim scientific inquiry to solve relevant scientific problems and to ultimately improve disease outcomes."

Her research focus is on metabolic and genetic pathways of cardiometabolic diseases, integrating diverse genomic, metabolomic and proteomic techniques for identification of novel mechanisms of disease and biomarkers. Her multi-disciplinary molecular epidemiology lab within the DMPI has quantitative and molecular components and leverages several large cardiovascular biorepositories on which she is PI or co-I to perform discovery studies using omics technologies, with subsequent functional validation for mechanistic insight. Dr. Shah collaborates closely with the DCRI for biomarker discovery in biospecimens from clinical trials and she is the Duke PI for the Verily Project Baseline study. She has partnered with the Duke Global Health Institute (DHGI) to identify disease biomarkers in global populations through a study of metabolic and genomic biomarkers of type II DM and CAD in Gurgaon, India. Dr. Shah is also Director of the Duke Adult Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic where she cares for patients and their families who have, or are at risk of, cardiovascular genetic disorders. Her training includes receiving a M.H.S. in epidemiology from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, a Master’s degree in Medical Genomics from Duke University, and completing a research fellowship in genetic epidemiology at the Duke Center for Human Genetics."

Members of his lab have developed gnotobiotic animal models, and new experimental and computational approaches to characterize the assembly, dynamic operations, functional properties, and biological effects of human gut microbial communities. He has combined these models with human studies involving twins as well as members of birth cohorts living in low-, middle- and high-income countries. His group is focused on addressing the global health challenges of obesity and childhood undernutrition through new understanding of the interactions between diets and the gut microbiome and through new ways of promoting healthy development of the gut microbial community during the first several years of postnatal life.

As we move through the 21st century, cutting-edge technology allows researchers to do more than ever before. From CRISPR-Cas to stem cell regeneration to high-throughput 'omics', new emerging technology has the potential to help us understand and answer science and medicine's most elusive questions. But what is important to consider when utilizing and implementing this technology in both basic research and clinical settings? Our panel will engage experts in the fields of bioethics and biotechnology as well as attendees, to discuss critical considerations surrounding the use and implementation of technology in biomedical research.",
