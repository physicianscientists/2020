Her laboratory is interested in understanding the pathomechanism of chronic kidney disease development. Susztak has made discoveries fundamental towards defining critical genes, cell types and mechanisms of chronic kidney disease. She was instrumental in defining genetic, epigenetic transcriptional changes in diseased human kidneys. She identified novel kidney disease genes and demonstrated the contribution of Notch signaling and metabolic dysregulation in kidney disease development. Her lab was the first to map the kidney epigenome and catalogue genotype-driven gene-expression variation (eQTL) in human kidneys. Integration of GWAS, eQTL and epigenome data has been essential to prioritize disease-causing genes and variants. Dr. Susztak generated the first unbiased, comprehensive kidney cell-type atlas using single cell transcriptomics. She identified that specific renal endophenotypes are linked and likely caused by the dysfunction of specific cell types."

My thesis project explores how antigen presentation and lymphatic drainage works for brain tumors. The hope is that developing a better understanding of this process could potentially elucidate more effective treatment strategies. I aspire to have a career where I can apply information I learn from lab to patients I see in clinic, and vice versa.

Her research focus is on metabolic and genetic pathways of cardiometabolic diseases, integrating diverse genomic, metabolomic and proteomic techniques for identification of novel mechanisms of disease and biomarkers. Her multi-disciplinary molecular epidemiology lab within the DMPI has quantitative and molecular components and leverages several large cardiovascular biorepositories on which she is PI or co-I to perform discovery studies using omics technologies, with subsequent functional validation for mechanistic insight. Dr. Shah collaborates closely with the DCRI for biomarker discovery in biospecimens from clinical trials and she is the Duke PI for the Verily Project Baseline study. She has partnered with the Duke Global Health Institute (DHGI) to identify disease biomarkers in global populations through a study of metabolic and genomic biomarkers of type II DM and CAD in Gurgaon, India. Dr. Shah is also Director of the Duke Adult Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic where she cares for patients and their families who have, or are at risk of, cardiovascular genetic disorders. Her training includes receiving a M.H.S. in epidemiology from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, a Master’s degree in Medical Genomics from Duke University, and completing a research fellowship in genetic epidemiology at the Duke Center for Human Genetics."

Dr. Lund joined NIH from a career in academia including appointments at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she held a Sarah Graham Kenan Distinguished Professorship in the Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology, and held joint appointments in Pediatrics and Nutrition. She also interacted with faculty in the Division of Gastroenterology and Neuroscience Center. Throughout her career, she partnered with clinician investigators. Her research and many (>200) publications focused on glucagon-like peptides (GLPs) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) including basic molecular biology, gene structure and regulation and roles in intestinal epithelial renewal, regeneration, inflammatory bowel diseases, aging and early stage cancer. Dr. Lund mentored many undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and early stage faculty, both Ph.D. and clinician scientists a majority of whom are succeeding as independent researchers.

Hannah began her journey with APSA in 2016 as a member of the Partnerships committee before moving on to Vice chair and Chair of the same committee. As President-Elect, she looks forward to facilitating diversity initiatives, strengthening partner relations, and ensuring that APSA serves as the voice of physician scientist trainees across the country. Loves: her German shepherd Zeus, Disney World, adventures, black coffee. Hates: pickles, movie spoilers, alarm clocks."
