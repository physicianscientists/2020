            <h4>John Hopkins University School of Medicine</h4>
            <p>Dr. Burns is a physician-scientist and practicing hematopathologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her research laboratory studies roles mobile genetic elements play in human disease. Her lab was one of the first to develop a targeted method to amplify mobile DNA insertion sites in the human genome for comprehensive insertion mapping. Their studies have shown that mobile element insertions represent a significant source of inherited structural variation in human populations, and the group has identified numerous potentially functional insertion variants at loci associated with human disease risk. Her lab also studies the expression and activity of mobile DNAs in human cancers. The lab has developed reagents to detect proteins encoded by active retrotransposons, namely, Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) open reading frame 1p (ORF1p) and ORF2p. They have shown aberrant expression of ORF1p in a wide variety of human cancers. This activation of LINE-1 is associated with somatic activity, and the Burns lab has mapped insertions of LINE-1 sequences acquired during the clonal evolution of gastrointestinal and ovarian cancers. The lab has ongoing projects to discern the functional consequences of somatically-acquired mobile element insertions, as well as other effects of ORF1p and ORF2p expression in malignancy. Dr. Burns recently served as co-Chair of a strategic workshop at the National Cancer Institute on roles of mobile genetic elements in cancer, and as the Organizer for a FASEB meeting on Mobile DNAs in the Mammalian Genome. She has authored numerous primary articles and reviews on human transposons and their roles in disease. Dr. Burns also serves as Vice Chair for Research for the Department of Pathology at Johns Hopkins, and as the inaugural Director of the institution’s Physician Scientist Training Program (PSTP).</p>

Their studies have revealed the conserved targets for immunosuppressive antifungal drugs and delineated calcineurin and Tor signaling pathways. In parallel, studies on dimorphic transitions led to the discovery of conserved mechanisms involved in nutrient sensing, including carbon and nitrogen sources, involving a novel G protein coupled receptor that senses sugars, and an ammonium permease related to the Rh antigens that senses nitrogen sources. Their studies in C. neoformans studies have led to definition of general principles of signal transduction that control cell development, and roles for the calcineurin, cAMP-protein kinase A, and MAP kinase cascades in mating and virulence. In parallel, they have delineated the structure and function of the mating type locus that governs development and virulence, and are currently examining the role of sexual recombination in the evolution of virulence in sub-Saharan Africa and an outbreak of C. neoformans variety gattii that is occurring on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.</p>

Orkin’s pioneering efforts defined the molecular basis of human blood disorders and mechanisms governing blood cell development. His early accomplishments led to the first comprehensive molecular dissection of an inherited disorder (the thalassemia syndromes).  He characterized genes responsible for other human blood disorders, including X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (the first positional cloning).  Orkin then transformed the study of blood stem cell development by identifying and characterizing the first hematopoietic transcription factors (the GATA family) and their critical co-activators. His recent landmark studies on BCL11A, a critical repressor of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), have illuminated regulation of the fetal-to-adult switch and improved prospects for HbF reactivation as genetic or pharmacological therapy of the thalassemias and sickle cell disease. These contributions to human genetics and medicine are unmatched for their breadth, focus, and broad impact. He is also an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Institute of Medicine, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, and recipient of the E.

            <h4>Washington University Pediatric Critical Care Medicine Division Director</h4>
            <p>Dr. Juliane Bubeck Wardenburg is the Strominger Endowed Professor of Pediatrics and Division Chief of Critical Care in the Department of Pediatrics at Washington University in St. Louis. She received her M.D. and Ph.D. degrees in Immunology from Washington University, subsequently pursuing clinical training in General Pediatrics and Pediatric Critical Care at the University of Chicago. During this time, Julie investigated the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infection in the laboratory of Dr. Olaf Schneewind in the Department of Microbiology as a Pediatric Scientist Development Program Fellow. Since 2008, the Bubeck Wardenburg laboratory has focused on the role of bacterial toxins in perturbation of host cellular and tissue homeostasis.</p>
            <p>Julie is known internationally for her expertise in the molecular pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus disease. Her laboratory has made seminal contributions to understanding how S. aureus alpha-toxin contributes to infection, positioning this protein as a leading target of S. aureus vaccines in human clinical trials. More recently, her laboratory has extended their scope of interest in bacterial toxins to the investigation of the Bacteroides fragilis toxin, revealing strategies for disease targeting based on genetically-informed perturbation of the colonic microbiome. She is the recipient of the 2011 Society for Pediatric Research Young Investigator Award and the 2011 University of Chicago Distinguished Investigator Award. In 2012, she was named a Burroughs Wellcome Investigator in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases and was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation.</p>

            <h4>Hebrew SeniorLife/Harvard Medical School</h4>
            <p>Dr. Inouye is an internationally recognized leader in geriatric medicine and aging research. She is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine, chaired the Delirium Clinical Guidelines Panel for the American Geriatrics Society, and serves as an Associate Editor of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Her research focuses on prevention of delirium and cognitive decline with aging, promoting healthy aging and independence follow acute illness, and improvement of healthcare systems through policy.</p>
            <p>Continuously NIH-funded since 1989 with over 50 grants and over 250 publications, Dr. Inouye developed the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)—the most widely used method for delirium identification, used in over 4000 publications and translated into 20 languages—along with the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) for delirium prevention, a cost-effective model of patient-centered care that has been disseminated to over 200 hospitals worldwide. She was recently awarded an R24 Delirium Network grant by the National Institutes of Health. She is committed to translating research into practice and policy changes.</p>
