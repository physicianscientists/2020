          <h3>Author Attendance Requirement</h3>
          <p>
          Submission of an abstract to the APSA Annual Meeting affirms that at least one author must register for and attend the meeting if the abstract is accepted for poster or oral presentation. At least one author must be present at the poster during the scheduled presentation session. Presenters are not required to be present during all viewing hours.
          </p>

          <!-- Presentation Guidlines -->
          <h3>Presentation Guidelines</h3>
          <h4>Size</h4>
          <p>Your poster must be no larger than 4 feet high by 4 feet wide. Two posters will be presented side-by-side on each board.  Pushpins will be provided.</p>
          
          <h4>Structure</h4>
          <p>A poster is a visual presentation of your research or clinical project. Use schematic diagrams, graphs, tables and other strategies to direct the visual attention of the viewer, rather than explaining it using text as you would in a journal article.</p>

These awards are meant to encourage and support interactions between APSA national and local chapters (LCs). To be eligible for this award, your institution must first form an APSA LC by completing the application process (please visit the LC page, or email <a href="mailto:localchapters@physicianscientists.org">localchapters@physicianscientists.org</a> with questions).
