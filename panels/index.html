            <h4>Janelle Taylor, PhD, Department of Anthropology Professor at the University of Washington</h4>
            <p>As a sociocultural anthropologist Dr. Janelle Taylor uses ethnographic methods to study health, illness, medical education, medical technology, and medical practice. Her research has focused on a variety of topics relating to medical technology, medical education, and medical practice, including fetal ultrasound imaging, medical decision- making at the end of life, how &#39;culture&#39; is understood and taught within medical education, the work of &quot;Standardized Patients&quot; and ther role in teaching and assessing clinical skills, and questions of recognition and care in relation to dementia. Recent research explores why friendships so often prove fragile after the onset of dementia, and how some friendships nonetheless manage to adapt and adjust. A new grant from the NIA will support research into whether and how differences in health outcomes and/or health care utilization among older adults with dementia may relate to availability of family to provide informal caregiving support. A thread running through all of Dr. Taylor&#39;s research is a concern to document and understand how representations inform social practices; how mediation happens between different systems of value; how &quot;persons&quot; are socially made (and unmade); and how medicine and health care are involved in all of this.</p>

            <p>Fisher holds a mark of distinction in the history books; she became the first mother in space when she flew on STS-51A.</p>
            <p>Anna Fisher graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry and a Doctor of Medicine degree from UCLA in 1971 and 1976, respectively. Fisher received a Master of Science degree in chemistry from UCLA in 1987. Fisher joined NASA in 1978 when she was selected as an astronaut candidate. A space flight veteran, Fisher spent 192 hours living and working on the space shuttle orbiter. On Nov. 8, 1984, Fisher flew as a mission specialist on STS-51A, the second flight of the Space Shuttle Discovery. During the mission, the crew deployed two satellites and operated the Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME) device. This was the first space salvage mission, as the crew retrieved the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI satellites to return to Earth. Fisher also supported shuttle missions STS-1 through STS-7 and served as Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-9. She worked as the deputy of the Mission Development branch of the Astronaut Office and served on the Astronaut Selection Board for the 1987 class of astronauts.</p>

            <p>Dani Dumitriu, MD, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and member of the Mindich Child Health and Development Institute and the Institute for Exposomic Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She holds these faculty appointments concurrent with clinical training, currently completing the fifth and final year of a combined General Pediatrics Residency and a fellowship in Pediatric Environmental Health. This unconventional route of combining residency training with starting a lab was born out of a deep fascination with the neurobiology of stress resilience, the focus of the Dumitriu lab. Having begun this work during a brief post-doctoral fellowship toward the end the MD/PhD program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, upon graduation, Dr. Dumitriu encountered the common physician-scientist predicament: the impossible choice between a prolonged absence from bench work versus continuing a research fellowship and giving up the rewards of clinical medicine. Refusing to make this difficult choice, upon matching into the Pediatric residency at the same institution, Dr. Dumitriu worked with the Departments of Pediatrics, Environmental Health and Neuroscience to develop a custom-tailored five-year track with integrated and increasing research effort. In Year 2, she was awarded a NARSAD Young Investigator award. In Year 3, she was appointed Assistant Professor in a Neuroscience, a non-clinical department. In Year 4, she was awarded an R01 from NIMH, making her the second documented resident (and first female resident) in the U.S. to receive the award during clinical training.</p>
